This repository contains the Tableau dashboard and supporting files for my analysis of a dummy dataset from Novacard Financial, a fictitious company compiling reports on credit card complaints. The analysis aimed to uncover key trends and insights into customer complaints, providing a comprehensive overview of the data.

## Project Overview

This project explores credit card complaint data to identify patterns and trends related to:

* **Top Companies with Most Complaints:** Identifying the financial institutions with the highest complaint volumes.
* **Complaint Resolution:** Analyzing the effectiveness and timeliness of complaint resolution.
* **Complaint Channels:** Understanding how customers file their complaints.
* **Geographical Distribution:** Examining complaint patterns across different states.
* **Temporal Trends:** Identifying key dates and overall trends in complaint volume over time.

## üìä Key Findings

The analysis revealed several interesting insights:

* **Top Companies:**
    * Citibank leads in complaint volume, followed by Capital One and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
    * Billing disputes are the most common complaint type.
    * Companies have achieved a high resolution rate, with over 99% of complaints resolved on time, primarily through explanations or monetary relief.
* **Complaint Channels:**
    * The web and referrals are the primary channels for filing complaints, highlighting the importance of digital platforms.
* **Geographical Distribution:**
    * California, New York, Florida, and Texas have the highest complaint counts, correlating with their large populations.
    * However, the order of complaint volume does not perfectly match the order of population.
    * North Dakota had the least amount of complaints.
    * Wyoming had 93 complaints, a relatively high number for its population.
* **Temporal Trends:**
    * September 9, 2020, saw the highest single-day complaint volume.
    * There has been a consistent increase in complaints over the years.
    * A 20% increase in complaints has been observed in the last 12 months, indicating a significant upward trend.
